# GuessTheNumber-CSharp

The program randomly generates a number between 0 and 1000 and prompts the player 
to guess the number. The player can enter numbers, and the program provides hints
to guide the player towards the correct answer. Once the player finds the correct
number, the program displays a congratulatory message. This project serves as a simple
demonstration of using loops and condition in C#.
